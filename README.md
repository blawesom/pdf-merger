**PDF Merger**

A simple API-based service to freely merge and serve pdf.
Python 2.7 and 3.5 compatible.

How does it works:
- You upload your pdf files through the API
- The server merge these files
- The result is uploaded on a secure platform and is hosted for one week, with a download limit of 1
- After this duration or the first download the file is deleted of the service
- The API returns you the link for the download
